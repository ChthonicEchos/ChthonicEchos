      <h1>Chthonic Echos</h1><br>
      <p>I am currently refreshing my HTML knowledge, bolstering my CSS skills, and learning JavaScript + accompanying frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>Please be gentle with me! If you are interested in seeing my progress during my journey, feel free to bookmark this website and check out Chthonic Echos on Github.
      </p>
      <p>This page will be art focused. On a future planned project, I will be creating a website to showcase my current skills in C++ and Java, and that page will be up and coming after I finish my Full stack course. I will also include a link to my blog once that is created. Hope you enjoy my journey and are inspired to get out there and create as well!
